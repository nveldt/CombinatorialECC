# README

This folder contains code for algorithms and experiments for the paper "Hypergraph clustering with categorical edge labels."

Nearly all code is written in Julia (run with version 1.1.1). The only exception is that  for Experiment 5.3, we also installed Graclus and use the Matlab interface. 

For questions about the code, contact nateveldt@gmail.com.
